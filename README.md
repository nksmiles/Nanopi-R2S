# OpenWrt for R2S with USB Wifi drivers

Complied based on Lean openwrt source code:
https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede/

## USB WiFi drivers
With most USB WiFi drivers included.

TL-WN722N (Atheros AR9271) works on my R2S. Others not tested.


## Luci apps:

Default apps by Lean's openwrt for Nanopi-R2s + [passwall](https://github.com/xiaorouji/openwrt-passwall) 

Other apps complied as ipk package.
It's recommanded to set your own OPKG source to install.

## How to use

It's supposed that you already know how to flash your system image to TF card.
Or use openwrt system upgrade.

Set your own OPKG source refer to below link:
